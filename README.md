This project implements an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process to manage a grocery inventory. Data is extracted from a MongoDB collection containing information about grocery products, including product names, categories, and prices. The extracted data is then transformed into a pandas DataFrame and loaded into a MySQL database for further analysis. This process helps demonstrate the integration of MongoDB and MySQL for efficient data storage and retrieval in a grocery inventory system.
